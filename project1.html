<h2 class="city"> <a href="file:///C:/Users/Rodolfo_Ochoa/Documents/mathindex.html"> Math </a> </h2>

</center>
<p> For this class we learn about varieties of lessons depending on what we're learning. For this sophmore year we're learning about Algebra 2 and everyone in sophmore year takes the same course. We work with people in our group and we all try different ways to solve complex problems. Overall we use CPM to do problems and find definitons in case we're stuck. It helps out students very much and in case if they're ever stuck they can use homework help which gives the step by step. Which homework help I believe it'll help those who are very stuck on certain problems in case. </p>

<h2 class="city"> <a href="file:///C:/Users/Rodolfo_Ochoa/Documents/englishindex.html"> English/Graphic Communications </a> </h2>

</center>
<p> In English we read and write depending on the project or book we're reading. Our teacher let's us do our own creative writing which allows students to have their style of writing and expressing of how they're feeling. Also in Graphic Communications we draw, editng pictures or editing anything using Adobe Photoshop so students can try their taste in ideas. I believe there are creative students out there and my teacher never let's the students shut down, he always gives them advice and always more room to improve during class. Students are very happy to have him in class. </p>

<h2 class="city"> <a href="file:///C:/Users/Rodolfo_Ochoa/Documents/chemistry.html"> Chemistry </a> </h2>

</center>
<p> In Chemistry we use different SEPs which stands for Science and Engineering Practices. Which has 8 different learning targets for students to have strengths and weakness. Students are able improve on some that they're struggling whether if it a project or homework. Students enjoy being in the class because some say their experiments are really fun to do. Students have room to improve and show others what he/she is capable of. Our chemistry teacher doesn't let students down and allows them to think of strategies so it makes them more comfortable during that time.</p>

<h2 class="city"> <a href= "file:///C:/Users/Rodolfo_Ochoa/Documents/history.html"> World History </a> </h2>

</center>
<p> In World History we learn about the past or present events. We all have a class disscussion about it and figure out what really happened because a bunch of students were curious. Recently students had watched a horrific event during class which was September 11th, 2001. A video being showed and it terrified students but some want to know why it happened </p>
