    <h3>OBESITY IS A PROBLEM THAT NEARLY EVERY NATION IN THE WORLD IS FACING BUT THERE IS MUCH THAT WE CAN DO TO FIX IT</h3>
    <span class="byline">WRITTEN BY: RICHARD ATTIAS</span>
	
    <p>More than 80,000 chemicals are registered for use in the
United States. Some of these chemicals are toxic to animals
and humans, and some interfere with the bodyâ€™s hormone
function. The ones that impact hormones are called
endocrine disrupting chemicals, or endocrine disruptors,
and are linked to a variety of diseases.

The term obesogens was coined around 2006, based on
research that showed that exposures to specific chemicals
during early development disrupted normal metabolic
processes and increased susceptibility to weight gain across
the life span.</p>

    <p>Millions of Americans and people worldwide are overweight
or obese. Obesity is a complex health disorder that affects
both adults and children. Childhood obesity has become a
serious problem in the United States.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <h2>"By eating many fruits and vegetables in place of fast food and junk food, people could avoid obesity."</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Black people have the highest rate of obesity in America, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which explains why much of the discourse surrounding obesity references race, Sanders laments.
    <p>Talking about the high rate of obesity among racial minorities is problematic, she contends, because doing so can effectively reify white superiority and maintain white dominance, especially at a time when fatness is deeply stigmatizing, fat bodies denote civic unfitness, and high white obesity rates jeopardize whiteness.
