    <h3>TECHNOLOGY IS, OF COURSE, A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD. FIRE CAN COOK OUR FOOD BUT ALSO BURN US.</h3>

    <p>Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth... these are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security and women's empowerment. Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.

Obesity in America is a growing problem, and not just in adults. Today, about one in three American kids and teens are overweight or obese; nearly triple the rate in 1963. Child obesity has quickly become one of the most serious health challenges of the 21st century.</p>

    <p>Based on diet recommendations established by the United States Department of Agriculture, only 2 percent of children have a healthy diet. In fact, in a survey of high school seniors, only three out of every 10 report eating vegetables “nearly” every day. Of the vegetables consumed, one-fourth is in the form of french fries or potato chips.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <h2>"We struggle with eating healthily, obesity, and access to good nutrition for everyone. But we have a great opportunity to get on the right side of this battle by beginning to think differently about the way that we eat and the way that we approach food."</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Black people have the highest rate of obesity in America, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which explains why much of the discourse surrounding obesity references race, Sanders laments.
    <p>Talking about the high rate of obesity among racial minorities is problematic, she contends, because doing so can effectively reify white superiority and maintain white dominance, especially at a time when fatness is deeply stigmatizing, fat bodies denote civic unfitness, and high white obesity rates jeopardize whiteness.
